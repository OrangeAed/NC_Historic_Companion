The church was used as a school for African American children in the 1930s. The church was restored in 1952, though these walls are original. Recent scans of the ground in the church have revealed unmarked graves, which may help us learn more about life in Brunswicktown during the Civil War."

This insignia was used to identify the cannon as belonging to the Confederate Army, with the smaller symbols specifying the details of its production.",
